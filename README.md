# Tailwind Projects
I am currently learning Tailwind CSS and will be consistently updating this repository with various mini projects that I build along the way. Each project will showcase different Tailwind components and techniques. For each mini project, you will find a dedicated folder containing a README.md file, along with images or GIFs demonstrating the project's functionality.
